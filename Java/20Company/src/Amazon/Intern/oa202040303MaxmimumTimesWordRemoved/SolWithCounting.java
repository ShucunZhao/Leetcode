/**
 * Maximum Times Word Removed üçÖ
 * ü§ò INTERN
 * Amazon Engineering maintains a large number of logs of operations across all products. A software engineer is debugging an issue in a product. An efficient way to analyze logs is to write automated scripts to check for patterns. The engineer wants to find the maximum number of times a target word can be obtained by rearranging a subset of characters in a log entry.
 * Given a log entry s and target word t, the target word can be obtained by selecting some subset of characters from s that can be rearranged to form string t and removing them from s. Determine the maximum number of times the target word can be removed from the given log entry.
 * Note: Both strings s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
 * Function Description
 * Complete the function maximumTimesWordRemoved in the editor.
 * maximumTimesWordRemoved has the following parameters:
 * String s: a log entry
 * String t: a target word
 * Returns
 * int: the maximum number of times the target word can be removed
 * Example 1:
 * Input:  s = "abacbc", t = "bca"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * All characters were removed from s.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input:  s = "abdadccacd", t = "edac"
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation:
 * It is not possible to form the target word t from the characters in s.
