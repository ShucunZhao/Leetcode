 * @Description
 * Location Of Data After Transfers
 * ðŸ¤˜ INTERN
 * X stores its data on different servers at different locations. From time to time, due to several factors, X needs to move its data from one location to another. This challenge involved keeping track of the locations of X's data and report them at the end of the year.
 * At the start of the year, X's data was located at n different locations. Over the course of the year, X's data was moved from one server to another m times. Precisely, in the ith operation, the data was moved from movedFrom[i] to movedTo[i]. Find the locations of the data after all m moving operations. Return the locations in ascending order.
 *
 * Note:
 * It is guaranteed that for any movement of data :
 * There is data at movedFrom[i].
 * There is no data at movedTo[i].
 * Returns
 * int[]: the locations storing data after all moves are made, in ascending order.
 *
 * Example 1:Input:  locations = [1, 7, 6, 8], movedFrom = [1, 7, 2], movedTo = [2, 9, 5]
 * Output: [5, 6, 8, 9]
 * Explanation:
 * Data begins at locations listed in locations. Over the course of the year, the data was moved three times.
 * Data was first moved from movedFrom[0] to movedTo[0], from 1 to 2. Next, it is moved from 7 to 9, and finally from location 2 to 5.
 * In the end, the locations where data is present are [5,6,8,9] in ascending order.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input:  locations = [1, 5, 2, 6], movedFrom = [1, 4, 5, 7] , movedTo = [4, 7, 1, 3]
 * Output: [1, 2, 3, 6]
