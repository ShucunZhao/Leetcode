/**
 * @Description
 * Count Games Won By Group1 (AMZ China)
 * ðŸ¤˜ INTERN
 * Amazon games is organizing a tournament of pair games where two teams of two players each compete against one another.
 *
 * There are two groups group1 and group2 of size neach. The skill levels of the ith players of the groups are group1[i] and group2[i]. Fro each pair of indices, (i, j)(0 <= i < j < n), the pair of players (group1[i]
 *   + group1[j]) compete in the pair game with (group2[i] + group2[j])
 *
 * Given group1 and group2, fine the number of games group1 will win. Since the answer can be large, report it modulo 109 + 7.
 *
 * Function Description
 *
 * Complete the function countGameWonByGroup1 in the editor.
 *
 * int group1[n]: The skills of the players of group1
 *
 * int group2[n]: The skills of the players of group2
 * Returns
 * int: The number of games won by group1 modulo 109 + 7.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input:  n = 3, group1 = [1, 2, 3], group2 = [3, 2, 1]
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * Explanation:
 * 1.Pair: (0,1), group1: [1,2], group2: [3,2], (1+2)<(3+2), so winner is group2
 * 2.Pair: (0,2), group1:[1, 3], group2: [3,1], (1+3)<(3+2), so tie
 * 3.Pair: (1,2), group1: [2,3], group2: [2,1], (2+3)>(2+1), so winner is group1
 * So the win times of group1 is 1.

        Sol: Because the each pairs can be treated as one on one(1 v 1) twice,                l    r
         Step1: so we can find all the ability difference between group1 and group2 in the same index, get the g1[i]-g2[i]
         ability-difference array: diff: [-2,0,2]. Step2: we sort it by ascending order to get the corresponding ability of
         group1 members sorted: [-2,0,2].  Step3: we use two pointers method to calculate the group1 member win cases:
         Step3.1: fix the most-right pointer which represent the strongest member of group1
         Step3.2: Then we move left pointer from left-most to right-1 pos and if only diff[left]+diff[right] is larger than 0
              that means all the pairs (left,right) of the group1 from left to right-1 will win(cause diff is ascending order)
         Step3.3: If the diff[left]+diff[right]<=0 we need to move left to left+1 cause this case of pair (left,right) for
         group1 will lose. Step4: Each time the step3 finished, we move the right to right-1 to determine the next larger
          group1 member situations.
